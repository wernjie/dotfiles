# dotfiles

This repository contains dotfiles and some scripts to setup my macOS system.

To have most apps setup up and running, simply execute `setup.sh`, which will automatically install formulae, casks and Mac App Store apps I use.

To install dotfiles and other configuration files, simply run the `configure.sh` script. It'll not override existing files, and only perform a soft link rather than copy the files.
